I’m Yossi Gisser, passionate about advancing in the fields of Data Science, Machine Learning, and (GEN) AI.

In my current role as an Algorithm Developer at I.L.M. Technologies & Innovation, I focus on developing and refining machine learning models for OCR applications, particularly for the Hebrew language. I’ve implemented Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) using TensorFlow and PyTorch, managing the entire pipeline from data collection and cleaning to segmentation and model training. My work includes integrating these models into production environments, where they form a crucial part of the OCR process. Additionally, I’ve developed a self-supervised system for data labeling, which increased the volume of labeled data by a factor of 100, and applied various heuristics and domain-specific knowledge to significantly enhance system accuracy.

Previously, as a Data Engineer at Pagaya, I played a key role in managing and onboarding data pipelines through automated processes using AWS S3, GitHub Actions, and ECS. My efforts ensured that the research department had access to ready-to-use data for conducting data-driven studies. I was also responsible for extensive data exploration, visualization, validation, and canonization of raw data from various platforms. A significant achievement was leading the reorganization of historical data files, which involved cleaning the database, onboarding data through detailed analysis and documentation, and properly storing it for future use. My role also involved close collaboration with the product team, researchers, and external partners to define data requirements, deliver impactful insights, and resolve any data-related challenges that arose.

With a B.Sc. in Data Science & Engineering from The Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, I achieved a GPA of 86 and was honored to be on the Dean's list for the winter 2021/2022. 

Outside of my academic and professional endeavors, I possess strong language skills, being fluent in Hebrew, Russian, and English. I take great pride in my extensive Torah studies, as well as my service in the IDF and my advanced ML studies. The mystery of AI and the magic of Python captivate me, driving my enthusiasm and passion for the field.

In terms of my profile, I am driven by a keen interest in learning, research, and understanding data for practical applications. I excel at determining priorities and managing time efficiently, making me an excellent team player and highly motivated individual.
